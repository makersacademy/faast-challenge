# Challenge: Architect Badge Test

The mayor of London has been really impressed by your work on the _boris bikes_ project.

He has contacted the Greater London Authority to access the _Transport for London Software Development and Deployment_ specifications for the new FAAST Tube System ( **Fast And Accessible Super Tube**). Your task, if you choose(*) to accept it is to implement the **FAAST** system so that it can be deployed into the London underground network.

The **FAAST** system will cater for the following:

- There will be a number of trains inside the system.
- Trains will travel from station to station.
- Inside of a station, when the train stops, passengers will alight and enter the carriages of the train.
- A Passenger will touch in at the station and touch out at the destination station.
- Each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers.
- Each train is made of a number of coaches.

## Bonus

If you want to impress the mayor of London even more you will add a charging system where the passengers can only touch in a station (and access the train) if their account has more than 2 GBP.

## Notes

Remember that you will have to review at least 3 **FAAST** Systems before a coach reviews yours.

Godspeed!


(*) - when we say choose we mean **do it**!
